## üéØ Vision

OpenRequest aims to be the **most efficient open source alternative** to Postman and Insomnia, focusing on:

- **üîí Local-First**: Complete privacy with offline functionality
- **‚ö° Performance**: Native Rust backend for blazing speed
- **üé® Modern UI**: Clean, intuitive React interface
- **üîß Developer-Centric**: Built by developers, for developers
- **üí∞ Always Free**: Core features remain free forever
- **üåê Future Cloud**: Optional premium cloud features for teams

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: Rust + Tauri 2.0
- **Database**: SQLite (local storage)
- **Scripting**: JavaScript V8 Engine
- **Authentication**: System keychain integration
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux

### Core Principles

1. **Local-First**: All data stored locally by default
2. **Privacy-Focused**: No telemetry, no tracking
3. **Performance-Optimized**: Native Rust for CPU-intensive tasks
4. **Developer-Friendly**: Keyboard shortcuts, dark mode, extensible
5. **Standards-Compliant**: Full Postman collection compatibility

## ‚öôÔ∏è Backend API Engine Capabilities

Our backend, written in Rust, currently supports the following features for making HTTP requests:

- **[‚úÖ] HTTP Methods**: Full support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD, and OPTIONS.
- **[‚úÖ] URL and Query Parameters**: Can target any URL and handles structured query parameters with automatic URL encoding.
- **[‚úÖ] Request Headers**: Full support for custom request headers.
- **[‚úÖ] Request Body**: Can send a request body as raw text.
- **[‚úÖ] Response Handling**: Captures and returns the status code, response headers, and response body.

### Future Backend Enhancements

- **Structured Authentication**: Dedicated UI and logic for Basic Auth, Bearer Token, API Key, and OAuth 2.0.
- **Advanced Request Body Types**: Support for `multipart/form-data` (file uploads) and `x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- **Cookie Management**: Automatic cookie storage and sending.
- **Advanced Connection Settings**: Connection timeouts, custom proxies, and redirect configuration.
